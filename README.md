# sphinxdocs
Odoo module (v12) to create user documentation with Sphinx
This modules allows using Sphinx to create user documentation in Odoo. 
The user can access the documentation through the added item to the user menu 'User Docs' (the Documentation item linking to Odoo online documentation has been renamed 'Odoo Docs').
Some example documentation has been added to get you started. 
Sphinx documentation is created by adding restructured text documents in the root of the module. In the same directory, run the Sphinx command `make html` to generate the documentation. Of course, you must have Sphinx installed to be able to generate the documentation.
